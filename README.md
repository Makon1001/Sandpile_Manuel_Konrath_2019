# Sandpile_Manuel_Konrath_2019
The goal of this project is to develop an hour-glass when looked from above. Letâ€™s imagine a rectangular grid, with each square containing grains of sand. When there are at least four grains of sand in the same square, it becomes unstable. It will then distribute a grain of sand into each of the 4 neighboring squares, and its own number will decrease by 4. One collapse can lead to another, which will create a chain reaction.
